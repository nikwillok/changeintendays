        I’m Anna, it’s lovely to meet you! Thank you for spending time here with
        me. What a privilege! As you get to know me through the Change in Ten
        Days programme you will hear about my hugely varied range of life
        experiences. You will also learn that I love to laugh (mostly at
        myself), and I choose a joyful life. In the darkest of circumstances, I
        have found priceless insights and growth and it has led me to find joy
        and happiness in unexpected places.

        Without spoiling all the fun, I can share with you a few things about
        myself. Born and raised (mostly by Mum) in Christchurch, New Zealand, I
        am the last of four children. For a range of reasons our family life
        didn’t always pan out as Mum (or any of us) would have hoped, but I was
        very much loved. Life takes unexpected turns however, and I found myself
        a survivor of sexual assault at 15 years old and I left home while still
        at high school, when I had just turned 17. My father passed away when I
        was in my early 20s. For much of my life I managed emotions through food
        and found myself successful in a professional full-time government job
        at 25 years old, weighing 205kg. I suffered from chronic depression but
        was gratefully able to fund myself to have a gastric bypass and lost
        more than 100kg. It changed me significantly physically (I lost more
        than 100kg) but it didn’t deal with the emotional difficulties or the
        inclination to compulsive habits. I have enjoyed more than 20 years of a
        rewarding professional career in leadership, advice provision, change
        management, strategic and operational planning, continuous improvement,
        communications and coaching.

        I have been privileged to work both in New Zealand and the Solomon
        Islands – a developing country. It was there I met the father of my two
        wonderful sons (still in the single digits), and we were married happily
        for five years before a difficult separation and divorce in 2015. Since
        then, the boys and I have spent most of the time living in the Solomon
        Islands (where I have been customarily adopted by a Solomon Island
        family) until we relocated to Brisbane in early 2021 and the pandemic
        brought us back home later the same year. During the last six years I
        have struggled with motherhood and a professional career, alcohol misuse
        and difficult romantic connections. But I have gained the richest
        insights working through these challenges in such contrasting cultural
        environments. As I write this, I am just over three years sober (by the
        grace of God), have an exciting array of professional opportunities
        before me and am intentionally choosing to pivot towards an exciting
        (and somewhat unknown) future. I love working alongside and supporting
        people and still commit a significant portion of my time to voluntary
        pursuits. I have a history of working voluntarily in the alcohol and
        other drug area in New Zealand, ran a cooking and life skills programme
        for two years for young male inmates and coached young entrepreneurs in
        the Solomon Islands.

        Life is unexpected, but even in its cruelest moments, there is beauty to
        be found. I am a living testament to that. And one of the keys to my
        success is my ability to embrace change – whether it feels comfortable
        or not. I would love to share this with you – and no matter where you
        are in this moment, there is no better time to change than right now.
        Let’s go!
